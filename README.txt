Hereâ€™s a Terraform example for launching a security-hardened EC2 instance on AWS, with a few good security practices out of the box:

Security Considerations Included:

Latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI

SSH access restricted to a specific IP

Instance launched in a private subnet (optional)

Enabled detailed monitoring

Security Group with minimal exposure

IAM role with least privilege

Root block device with encryption



Best Practices:

Use EC2 Image Builder for hardened AMIs (CIS, STIG)

Enable CloudWatch agent for advanced metrics/logs

Enable GuardDuty, Inspector, and Config

Attach WAF/Shield if public facing

Use Systems Manager Session Manager instead of SSH

Limit subnet with Network ACLs
